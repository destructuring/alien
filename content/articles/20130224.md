## make for project dependencies

Using make to build a project's basic requirements to run scripts, such
as git submodules, bundling ruby gems, and creating python virtualenvs.
In scripts, just call `make` as the first thing in your project's home.

## microwave for project setup

After make, microwave can set up a project where git versioning is not
enough.  Since some setup cannot be automated, like putting your
credentials into `config/aws.yml`, microwave is not called in the
Makefile.

microwave is, for now, a symlink to chef-solo.  I tried using chef-apply
but that doesn't load cookbook attributes, etc.  I'd rather load a
cookbook's files and alter the run_list to run different recipe scripts.
