    <h2>Tuesday, February 19, 2013</h2>

<p>Decided I&#39;d write a post everyday I did something cool at my desk, get
into a habit of writing, similar to a resolve to commit things in my
$HOME directory to GitHub.  I write a lot of code but barely any
documentation (and don&#39;t ask me about tests).</p>

<p>This repo, alien, is a basic ghp (git home page) project that generates
a static site and publishes to GitHub Pages.  This article is published
using a bunch of custom tools:</p>

<pre><code>new article
vi content/articles/20130219.md
build site
publish site
git sync --all
</code></pre>

<h2>awsme</h2>

<p>The new job is 100% on ec2 but the build tools had a lot of hardcoded
strings and didn&#39;t deal with setup.  <code>awsme</code> brings the <code>ec2/ami</code> cli
tools, the new <code>aws</code> Python tool, and the ruby <code>aws-sdk</code> library together
with a single credentials configuration file in <code>config/aws.yml</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>ec2/ami</code> tools are wrapped so I can automatically supply credentials
and echo the commands.  You supply the binaries in <code>vendor/projects</code> and
then run <code>bin/setup projects</code> for the wrappers into <code>install/</code></p>

<p>The <code>aws</code> Python is vendored into <code>vendor/cache/pip/</code> with a
<code>virtualenv</code> configuration that doesn&#39;t require network access.  It&#39;s
useful enough that I created a project <code>puddle</code>, a Python &quot;bundler&quot; of
sorts.</p>

<h2>Miscellaneous scripts</h2>

<p>Split out miscellaneous scripts from my <code>home</code> project into <code>whatever</code>,
seeding it with my <code>talign</code> script that formats input into columns
(useful for <code>df</code> output).  I&#39;ll be add json and yaml stable sort
formatters, soon.</p>

<h2>Miscellaneous notes</h2>

<p>I used Dropbox to sync text notes but this felt wrong.  To my <code>paul</code>
project I added <code>git gist</code> which lets me list gists:</p>

<pre><code>git gist destructuring
</code></pre>

<p>Then I can use an egrep-compatible regex to narrow the list to one item,
and it gets cloned:</p>

<pre><code>git gist destructuring notes
</code></pre>

<h2>tome</h2>

<p>Packages that start services and provide configuration files conflict
with config management because you have two sources of truth for what is
run and written.  <code>tome</code>, which I came across while reading about
lobotomy, means to cut, and is a top-level project about Ubuntu packages
that have startup scripts and config files surgically removed; the
package is sewn together and hopefully adjusts to its new managed
environment.</p>

<p>There are lots of smaller ideas for tools to support <code>tome</code> because
things like the Debian package format and <code>reprepro</code> are crazy arcane.</p>
