<h2>good-bye capistrano</h2>

<p>I&#39;d been trying to get chef and capistrano to work together but then I
revisited chef deploy resource.  With microwave, I can cook the app on
my workstation; deploys are ssh + workarea init, and then a cook.</p>

<p>Abandoning my capistrano projects means I can close out my emotional
entanglements with the last job, too.</p>

<h2>grant microwave unification</h2>

<p>Using microwave to unify configuration management, application deploy,
workstation setup, maintenance scripts, scaffolding generation.  I&#39;ve
found my forever project for 2013.</p>

<h2>tvd-tvdinner</h2>

<p>To make a new tvdinner, just bundle tvd-tvdinner in Gemfile, and run
<code>bundle exec microwave init</code> in a directory with the same name as the
tvdinner gem.  Enough scaffolding to build and publish a gem will be
generated.  This will get rid of the <code>tvdinner</code> mixin.  Aspects of the
<code>init</code> command can be supplied on the command line.</p>

<h2>ad-hoc attributes</h2>

<p>Backing <code>microwave init</code> is chef-solo.  A way to pass in override
attributes would make chef scripts practical.  Examples:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>add_resque_workers +1</code> calls <code>microwave --recipe add_resque_workers inc_workers=+1</code></li>
<li><code>new tvdinner --name tvd-meh</code> calls <code>microwave --recipe tvdinner::scaffolding tvd.name=tvd-meh</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The attributes are not command switches so they won&#39;t conflict with
options parsing libraries.  <code>chef-apply</code> could be useful to implement
<code>--recipe</code>.</p>

<h2>geminabox or Dropbox</h2>

<p>Using geminabox locally and sync the repo using Dropbox.  Could the repo
be a git repository, too?  So the project to serve private gems could
use a git submodule, like gollum app could use a submodule for the wiki.</p>

<h2>bogoops</h2>

<p>I&#39;ll tweet some #bogoops stories as I remember them.  There are some
smart people who as also dumbasses and assholes and plain fucking sad.
Here&#39;s where I make fun of them because I don&#39;t work with them any more :)</p>
