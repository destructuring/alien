<h2>make for project dependencies</h2>

<p>Using make to build a project&#39;s basic requirements to run scripts, such
as git submodules, bundling ruby gems, and creating python virtualenvs.
In scripts, just call <code>make</code> as the first thing in your project&#39;s home.</p>

<h2>microwave for project setup</h2>

<p>After make, microwave can set up a project where git versioning is not
enough.  Since some setup cannot be automated, like putting your
credentials into <code>config/aws.yml</code>, microwave is not called in the
Makefile.</p>

<p>microwave is, for now, a symlink to chef-solo.  I tried using chef-apply
but that doesn&#39;t load cookbook attributes, etc.  I&#39;d rather load a
cookbook&#39;s files and alter the run_list to run different recipe scripts.</p>
